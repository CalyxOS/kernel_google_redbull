      "message": "The reason for this change is that a new symbol was added via android-4.19-stable which breaks the GKI symbol list checks. The scripts to regenerate the lists don\u0027t work in our kernel build setup (or I couldn\u0027t figure out how to do it). We don\u0027t really care about GKI compatibility, let alone this is 4.19 that does not even have official GKIs.",
